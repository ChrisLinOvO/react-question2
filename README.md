- tip: If Calendar is running, you can open the "Chrome Devtools Console" and print out the start date and end date selected by the calendar.

## Introduction

As part of an interview challenge available at [react-question2.pdf](https://github.com/ChrisLinOvO/react-question2/files/13509153/react-question2.pdf), the task involves creating a Calendar Component. 

First, I build a "custom-hook" designed to render the Calendar UI with dates, states, and trigger functional events...，These features are exported to be utilized by the "Calendar Component".

The purpose is to consolidate the logic of the same functionality into a hook that can be reused.
